# **Thurii**: Your Ideal Companion for Outdoor Adventures

## Introduction
Thurii is much more than just a hiking app. **As the founder and backend developer**, I had the pleasure of working on this exciting project, developed as part of my three-year studies.  
It‚Äôs a mobile app that **centralizes all hiking-related data** to help, guide, and secure both new and experienced hikers in their practice.

As part of this project, we won the **Most Innovative Project Award** and the **Best Idea Award** during the Warm-Up Days in Lyon, which allowed us to participate in the final in Paris at the **Epitech Experience** event.

## Project Development üå±

### Design and Planning üõ†Ô∏è
The Thurii project was created in November 2021, with the idea of allowing users to **quickly and easily plan their outdoor adventures**. We began by developing a proof of concept in January 2022, followed by the start of development in April 2022.

### Challenges Faced üöß
One of the biggest challenges was **managing a team spread across three different continents for one year**. It was also difficult to organize work alongside our studies and internships. These challenges required **clear communication and careful planning**.

### Solutions Implemented üí°
To overcome these challenges, we conducted **several user satisfaction surveys** to gather constructive feedback. This allowed us to adjust our development according to users' needs and expectations. We also ran a **social media campaign**: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/thurii/), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/thurii_fr/), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/people/Thurii/61550589122135/).

## Final Result üìà
Upon the release of our beta version in April 2023, we gathered **around 100 users in just two months**, with overall positive feedback on the app's concept and design. Although the app was available on the Google Play Store, it is currently no longer available.

### Lessons Learned üìö
Throughout this project, I learned **the importance of team collaboration**, especially with members located on different continents. Working with Android and iOS developers **enriched my knowledge** and allowed me to better understand the various aspects of app development. The recognition we received with the **Best Pitch Award** and **Innovation Award** in Lyon, as well as our participation in a final in Paris in front of several companies, was a tremendous honor.

## Conclusion üéâ
Thurii is designed to make your outdoor adventures **more accessible and enjoyable**. We are excited to see how our community grows and evolves through this app. We invite you to stay tuned to our work as we continue to develop and improve Thurii.
